- [Link to problem 10](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ajkim141/project_euler/blob/master/Problem10.ipynb)
Problem 10 should theoretically work (it is correct with smaller ranges) but it takes too long to run up to 2000000. It probably needs a more efficient way of finding primes.

- [Link to problem 12](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ajkim141/project_euler/blob/master/Problem12.ipynb)
Problem 12 has the same problem as 10. It is correct within smaller number ranges, but it is too inefficient to be run for larger ranges.
